# Introduction: Agentic Design Patterns

> **Note:** This documentation series was created through collaborative exploration with Claude (Anthropic). The findings, code examples, and insights emerged from hands-on experimentation and research sessions investigating how each framework approaches agentic patterns.

## What Are Agentic Design Patterns?

Agentic design patterns are reusable architectural approaches for building AI applications that go beyond simple prompt-response interactions. These patterns enable:

- **Multi-step reasoning** - Breaking complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Tool usage** - Integrating external capabilities (search, APIs, databases)
- **Self-correction** - Evaluating and improving outputs
- **Autonomous workflows** - Coordinating multiple AI components

## The Patterns We'll Explore

| Pattern | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Prompt Chaining** | Sequential prompts where output feeds into the next | Data extraction → transformation → validation |
| **TBD** | TBD | TBD | 

## Why Compare Frameworks?

Different frameworks make different trade-offs:

- **Abstraction level** - High-level chains vs low-level API calls
- **Flexibility** - Opinionated patterns vs build-your-own
- **Lock-in** - Framework-specific vs portable code
- **Infrastructure** - Cloud-dependent vs self-hostable

Understanding these trade-offs helps you choose the right tool for your context.

## Frameworks Overview

See [frameworks-overview.md](./frameworks-overview.md) for detailed positioning of each framework.
